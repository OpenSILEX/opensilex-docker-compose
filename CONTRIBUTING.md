# Contributing to opensilex-docker-compose

Thank you for your interest in contributing to opensilex-docker-compose! We appreciate all contributions, whether they're code improvements, documentation updates, bug reports, feature requests, or anything else. Here's how you can help:

## Guidelines

### Questions Before Contributing

If you have a question about the project, consider opening an issue first to discuss it. This ensures that others can weigh in and provides a centralized place for discussion.

### Ground Rules

- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse points of view and experiences.
- Keep discussions constructive and positive.
- Communicate openly and honestly.

### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through the `Issues` tab to find tasks labeled as `good first issue`.

### Reporting Bugs

Report bugs by opening an issue with ``bug template``. Please provide details like the error message, environment, and steps to reproduce the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitLab issues. Create an issue to propose a new feature or improvement.

### Merge Request Process

1. Fork the Project
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b branch-name`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin branch-name`)
5. Open a Merge Request

#### Note: Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but larger changes should look like this:

```
Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72 characters or so.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Explain the problem the change addresses and why it's needed
- Explain the change you've made
- Mention any dependencies you've changed or added
- Explain users of older environments or database schema changes
- Explain places you believe the code will affect
- Explain other effects of this MR

## Setup

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Refer to the official Docker documentation for installation instructions.

### Local Setup

Follow the setup instructions in the [README.md](README.md) to get the project running locally.

### Making Changes

- Create a named branch for your changes (`git checkout -b my-feature-branch`)
- Make commits of logical units of work; no half-done work.
- Use a descriptive commit message.

```sh
git commit -m "Adds feature X"
```

### Building and Testing

After making changes, ensure your code runs successfully with
```bash
docker compose --env-file opensilex.env build --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g)
docker compose --env-file opensilex.env up start_opensilex_stack -d
```
and passes any existing tests.

## Submitting Changes

Open a Merge Request with a clear `title` and `description`. Explain what you did and why.

## Our Standards

- **Have fun!** ðŸŽ‰
```

Remember, the goal of the project is to make it easy for anyone to contribute. Let's keep things friendly and professional!

Feel free to modify this template to fit your project's specifics, such as specific setup instructions, testing frameworks, or additional guidelines you'd like contributors to follow.

## Additional Notes

Contributions are what make open-source projects thrive. Thank you for being interested in contributing to opensilex-docker-compose!

## Guide to Contributing

To contribute to opensilex-docker-compose, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Fork the Project

Fork this repository to your GitLab account.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://forgemia.inra.fr/OpenSILEX/opensilex-docker-compose.git
cd opensilex-docker-compose
```

### Step 3: Make Changes

Make your changes in a new git branch:

```sh
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### Step 4: Build and Test Locally

Ensure your changes don't break the build. If there are tests, run them:

```bash
docker compose --env-file opensilex.env build --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g)
```

### Step 5: Commit Changes

Commit your changes:

```sh
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
```

### Step 6: Push Changes

Push your changes to GitLab:

```sh
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

### Step 7: Open a Merge Request

Create a merge request against the main branch.

### Our Standards

- **Do not** rebase your branch off `main`.
- **Include screenshots of the UI and save them in the GitLab repository.
